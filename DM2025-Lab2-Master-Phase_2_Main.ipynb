       "**1. Evolutionary History and Domestication:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Dogs:** Descended from wolves, dogs were domesticated much earlier (estimated 15,000-40,000 years ago). This long history of cohabitation with humans has led to a strong pack mentality and a deep-seated desire to please their human companions.\n",
       "*   **Cats:** Descended from wildcats, cats were domesticated later (estimated 9,500 years ago). Their domestication was more of a mutualistic relationship, where cats were attracted to human settlements for rodent control, and humans benefited from their pest-catching abilities. This has resulted in a more independent nature.\n",

       "**2. Social Structure and Behavior:**\n",

This makes them generally more eager to please, trainable, and prone to separation anxiety if left alone for too long.\n",
       "*   **Cats:** While cats can form social bonds, they are more solitary hunters by nature. They are less reliant on a pack structure and tend to be more independent. They can be affectionate and form strong bonds with their owners, but their social needs are often met differently than dogs.\n",
       "\n",
       "**3. Communication:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Dogs:** Communicate through a variety of vocalizations (barking, whining, growling, howling), body language (tail wags, ear position, posture), and facial expressions. Their communication is often more overt and easily interpreted by humans.\n",
       "*   **Cats:** Communicate through a more subtle range of vocalizations (meowing, purring, hissing, growling), body language (tail position, ear movements, blinking, rubbing), and scent marking. Their communication can be more nuanced and sometimes harder for humans to decipher.\n",
       "\n",
       "**4. Training and Trainability:**\n",

       "*   **Dogs:** Generally highly trainable due to their desire to please and pack mentality. They respond well to positive reinforcement and can learn a wide range of commands and tricks.\n",
       "*   **Cats:** Can be trained, but it often requires a different approach. They are motivated by rewards (food, play) and are less driven by a desire to obey commands for their own sake. Training often focuses on shaping natural behaviors rather than teaching entirely new ones.\n",
       "\n",
       "**5. Diet and Hunting Instincts:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Dogs:** Omnivores, though they have a strong carnivorous inclination. They can digest a wider variety of foods and are less picky eaters than cats.\n",
       "*   **Cats:** Obligate carnivores. Their bodies are designed to process meat, and they require specific nutrients found only in animal tissue. They have a strong hunting instinct and often enjoy playing with toys that mimic prey.\n",

       "### Deeper Dive into the Key Differences\n",
       "\n",
       "#### 1. Social Structure and Behavior\n",
       "*   **Dogs:** Because they evolved from pack animals, dogs have an innate desire to be part of a family or group. They often look to their human as the \"alpha\" or pack leader. This is why they are generally easy to train—they are hardwired to follow commands and work together. They often suffer from separation anxiety if left alone for too long.\n",
       "*   **Cats:** As descendants of solitary hunters, cats are independent and territorial. They don't have a pack hierarchy. When a cat rubs against you or sits on your lap, it's a sign of affection and trust, not submission. They are perfectly happy to spend large parts of the day alone, as long as their needs are met.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### 2. Communication\n",
       "*   **Dogs:** A dog's bark can mean many things (alert, excitement, boredom), and a tail wag can signal happiness, nervousness, or aggression depending on its speed and height. They are very expressive and open with their body language.\n",
       "*   **Cats:** A cat's \"meow\" is a fascinating behavior that they primarily use to communicate with humans, not other cats. A purr can mean contentment, but it can also be a self-soothing mechanism when they are stressed or in pain. Their communication is often more subtle than a dog's.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### 3. Physical Abilities\n",
       "*   **Dogs:** Are built like marathon runners. Their bodies are designed for stamina and chasing down prey. Their non-retractable claws give them excellent grip while running.\n",
       "*   **Cats:** Are built like sprinters and acrobats. Their incredibly flexible spine allows them to twist and fit into small spaces, and their powerful hind legs give them explosive jumping ability. Retractable claws keep their \"weapons\" sharp for the perfect moment to strike.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### 4. Training and Motivation\n",
       "*   **Dogs:** Are often motivated by a desire to please their owner, in addition to treats and praise. This makes them ideal for complex tasks like search-and-rescue, service work, and herding.\n",
       "*   **Cats:** Are motivated almost entirely by reward. To train a cat, you must convince them that performing the action is worth their while (usually with a high-value treat). They are intelligent but less inclined to perform a task just because you asked.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Which Pet is Right for You?\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Choose a dog if:** You have an active lifestyle, want a companion for outdoor activities, have time for training and daily exercise, and want an animal that will actively participate in your family life.\n",
       "*   **Choose a cat if:** You have a less active lifestyle, live in a smaller space like an apartment, work long hours, and want a more independent companion who will give you affection on their own terms.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ultimately, both dogs and cats make wonderful, loving companions. The \"better\" pet is simply the one that best fits your personality and lifestyle."

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth.

      "Stranger Things — Review & Analysis \n",
      "Stranger Things, created by Matt and Ross Duffer, is a rare example of a modern \n",
      "series that successfully blends nostalgia, emotional storytelling, and supernatural \n",
      "mystery. Set in the 1980s suburban town of Hawkins, Indiana, the show constructs a \n",
      "world that feels familiar yet unsettling. Much like Nolan’s Interstellar uses cosmic \n",
      "vastness to evoke human fragility, Stranger Things uses small-town familiarity as the \n",
      "backdrop for extraordinary events. \n",
      "At its core, the series is not about monsters or alternate dimensions, but about \n",
      "human connections — particularly friendship and loyalty. The bond among the main \n",
      "group of kids — Mike, Lucas, Dustin, and the missing Will — forms the emotional \n",
      "center of the story. Their search for Will is not simply a mystery plot, but a symbolic \n",
      "journey into the unknown, where childhood innocence encounters the terrifying \n",
      "uncertainty of growing up. \n",
      "Visually, the series draws heavily from 1980s cinema, echoing directors like Spielberg \n",
      "and Carpenter. The aesthetic is instantly recognizable: warm tungsten lighting, synth-\n",
      "heavy soundtrack, analog textures. The use of practical effects and grainy color \n",
      "palettes grounds the supernatural elements in something tactile — something that \n",
      "feels like it belongs to that media era. This stylistic decision enhances the \n",
      "believability of the Upside Down, making it feel like a world we might have feared as \n",
      "children but dismissed as imagination. \n",
      "The performances elevate the material significantly. Millie Bobby Brown’s portrayal \n",
      "of Eleven is especially compelling — she embodies silence, trauma, and vulnerability, \n",
      "balanced with explosive telekinetic capability. Eleven is both weapon and wounded \n",
      "child, both experiment and human being. Through her, the show asks: What makes a \n",
      "person human — power or empathy? Similarly, Winona Ryder delivers a raw and \n",
      "frantic performance as Joyce Byers, a mother whose determination overrides \n",
      "rationality. Her refusal to accept Will’s disappearance as final becomes a powerful \n",
      "portrayal of maternal intuition. \n",
      "Narratively, the show weaves together multiple plot threads — the kids’ investigation, \n",
      "the teenagers’ storyline, and the adult conspiracy arc involving Hawkins National \n",
      "Laboratory. Each storyline reveals a different scale of the unknown: personal,\n",
      "\"\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Page 2**\n",
      "\"\"\"\n",
      "interpersonal, and institutional. The Upside Down, therefore, functions not only as a \n",
      "physical alternate dimension, but also as a metaphor — a reflection of the unseen \n",
      "fears beneath everyday life. \n",
      "But the show is not flawless. At times, the nostalgia can feel self-aware to the point \n",
      "of indulgence. The series occasionally relies on references rather than originality — \n",
      "leaning on what audiences remember rather than what audiences discover. However, \n",
      "even when the series plays into nostalgic expectation, it does so with sincerity rather \n",
      "than cynicism. The creators clearly love the media they reference, and the affection \n",
      "is contagious. \n",
      "Ultimately, Stranger Things succeeds because it treats its young characters with \n",
      "seriousness rather than condescension. The show understands that childhood is not \n",
      "a carefree state, but a period of intense emotional stakes — where friendships feel \n",
      "eternal, betrayals are devastating, and fear is absolute. In that sense, the show is not \n",
      "just about monsters in another world, but about the psychological monsters of \n",
      "adolescence: loneliness, insecurity, belonging, and transformation. \n",
      "In conclusion, Stranger Things is more than a sci-fi horror show. It is a story about \n",
      "connection in the face of the unknown — a reminder that even when darkness \n",
      "approaches, the presence of others gives us strength. With strong performances, \n",
      "evocative visuals, and a deeply human core beneath the supernatural surface, the \n",
      "series earns its cultural impact. For many viewers, the most “strange” thing is not the \n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nStranger Things — Review & Analysis \\nStranger Things, created by Matt and Ross Duffer, is a rare example of a modern \\nseries that successfully blends nostalgia, emotional storytelling, and supernatural \\nmystery. Set in the 1980s suburban town of Hawkins, Indiana, the show constructs a \\nworld that feels familiar yet unsettling. Much like Nolan’s Interstellar uses cosmic \\nvastness to evoke human fragility, Stranger Things uses small-town familiarity as the \\nbackdrop for extraordinary events. \\nAt its core, the series is not about monsters or alternate dimensions, but about \\nhuman connections — particularly friendship and loyalty. The bond among the main \\ngroup of kids — Mike, Lucas, Dustin, and the missing Will — forms the emotional \\ncenter of the story. Their search for Will is not simply a mystery plot, but a symbolic \\njourney into the unknown, where childhood innocence encounters the terrifying \\nuncertainty of growing up. \\nVisually, the series draws heavily from 1980s cinema, echoing directors like Spielberg \\nand Carpenter. The aesthetic is instantly recognizable: warm tungsten lighting, synth-\\nheavy soundtrack, analog textures. The use of practical effects and grainy color \\npalettes grounds the supernatural elements in something tactile — something that \\nfeels like it belongs to that media era. This stylistic decision enhances the \\nbelievability of the Upside Down, making it feel like a world we might have feared as \\nchildren but dismissed as imagination. \\nThe performances elevate the material significantly. Millie Bobby Brown’s portrayal \\nof Eleven is especially compelling — she embodies silence, trauma, and vulnerability, \\nbalanced with explosive telekinetic capability. Eleven is both weapon and wounded \\nchild, both experiment and human being. Through her, the show asks: What makes a \\nperson human — power or empathy? Similarly, Winona Ryder delivers a raw and \\nfrantic performance as Joyce Byers, a mother whose determination overrides \\nrationality. Her refusal to accept Will’s disappearance as final becomes a powerful \\nportrayal of maternal intuition. \\nNarratively, the show weaves together multiple plot threads — the kids’ investigation, \\nthe teenagers’ storyline, and the adult conspiracy arc involving Hawkins National \\nLaboratory. Each storyline reveals a different scale of the unknown: personal,\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n**Page 2**\\n\"\"\"\\ninterpersonal, and institutional. The Upside Down, therefore, functions not only as a \\nphysical alternate dimension, but also as a metaphor — a reflection of the unseen \\nfears beneath everyday life. \\nBut the show is not flawless. At times, the nostalgia can feel self-aware to the point \\nof indulgence. The series occasionally relies on references rather than originality — \\nleaning on what audiences remember rather than what audiences discover. However, \\neven when the series plays into nostalgic expectation, it does so with sincerity rather \\nthan cynicism. The creators clearly love the media they reference, and the affection \\nis contagious. \\nUltimately, Stranger Things succeeds because it treats its young characters with \\nseriousness rather than condescension. The show understands that childhood is not \\na carefree state, but a period of intense emotional stakes — where friendships feel \\neternal, betrayals are devastating, and fear is absolute. In that sense, the show is not \\njust about monsters in another world, but about the psychological monsters of \\nadolescence: loneliness, insecurity, belonging, and transformation. \\nIn conclusion, Stranger Things is more than a sci-fi horror show. It is a story about \\nconnection in the face of the unknown — a reminder that even when darkness \\napproaches, the presence of others gives us strength. With strong performances, \\nevocative visuals, and a deeply human core beneath the supernatural surface, the \\nseries earns its cultural impact. For many viewers, the most “strange” thing is not the \\nUpside Down itself — but how deeply the show makes us care about a group of kids \\nfacing it together.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

For this you need to load the results with pandas and handle the data using its dataframe functions. Discuss about the findings."

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
